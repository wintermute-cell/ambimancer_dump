# Ambimancer
Ambimancer is a suite of programs, providing a complete set of tooling to
create, share and play ambient soundscapes.

Each Ambimancer component can be used as a standalone tool, being compatible
with all kinds of different software.

## Overall Goals
The project is split up into several components to provide a separation of
concerns. This will make development of the individual components easier by 
reducing complexity.

The following tools shall be present in the Ambimancer toolset:
- Macropad :: controlling the entire suite through an intuitive UI.
- Music Player :: making and playing music playlists from local files 
  (and eventually external sources).
- Ambient Player :: making and playing ambiences built out of looping sound 
  effects. (Using local files and eventually external sources).
- Share Hub :: a central platform to share and distribute profiles and setups
  for the tool included in Ambimancer.

## Tools
### Mpad (Macropad)
Mpad (short for Macropad) is a server program that provides a *streamdeck* like
User Interface as a web-page. The server can be configured to offer a number
of custom buttons, each of them running predefined commands as they are run.

Goals:
- A more intuitive and easy to use interface to create buttons.
- Cross platform compatibility.
- User-friendly integration of external services.
